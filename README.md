## 📌 Project Overview

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. This project applies supervised machine learning models to analyze medical and demographic data and predict whether a patient is at risk of stroke.

The system processes real-world healthcare data, trains multiple models, and evaluates their performance to identify the most accurate and reliable approach.
