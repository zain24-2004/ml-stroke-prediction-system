# Stroke Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the risk of stroke using Machine Learning techniques based on patient health records and lifestyle information. Early stroke risk prediction can support preventive healthcare and clinical decision-making.

##  Project Overview

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. This project applies supervised machine learning models to analyze medical and demographic data and predict whether a patient is at risk of stroke.

The system processes real-world healthcare data, trains multiple models, and evaluates their performance to identify the most accurate and reliable approach.
